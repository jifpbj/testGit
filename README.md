# testGit

This is a project to test git functionality. I have some trouble with git commands in the terminal, so I am using this project to practice.

Edit this in VS CODE or Lazyvim. Who cares!

Just try to commit the changes to git

Done through the Odin Project

Some more commits done in VIM to see if I can do the commit message in VIM as well, since I'm comfortable with it.

Even more times I wonder if this will work.
